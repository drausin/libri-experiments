## exp01 - How does performance degrade with increasing user load?

What happens to libri network performance as user load increases? Network performance is measured primarily by metrics on the aggregate librarians:
- CPU usage
- memory usage
- Put/Get response times (p50, p95)
- availability %

#### experiments

- exp01a: how does performance degrade over 100, 1K, 10K daily active users?
